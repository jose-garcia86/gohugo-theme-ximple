# Learning to Code? Why You May Not Need a Tech Degree 

Degrees in IT and computer science are still hot property in today’s job market, but are formal qualifications necessary to be a successful developer? We looked into the options people have when it comes to learning how to code.

## Bootcamp
Attending a coding bootcamp exposes you to necessary languages whilst you benefit from a range of career services, including building a portfolio of web applications.

You’ll need to shop around until you find something that offers you the best quality/price ratio, but also feels right. The best bootcamp for you will be the one that fits your needs at a specific time. It can be an intense full-time course, or a part-time course you can plan around your life.

Self-learning and bootcamp can be a lot more agile than university because they're driven by the private sector and can keep up with the changes needed for the industry, Berlin developer Adam says. He now works as a coding teacher and is the co-founder of an app that wants to democratise the way accommodation, particularly among marginalised communities, gets managed.

23- year-old Australian software engineer Gemma was studying Sociology through university when she decided to dip her toe into web development with mixed results. ‘I decided I was going to try coding online through uni, and I tried to do two subjects… and failed them miserably.’

Seeking a more hands-on training approach from self-learning, Gemma decided to take the plunge, quitting her job to attend an intense six-month coding bootcamp. Where she learned enough to be fully employable by the end of the course.

I have seen so many bootcamp graduates become amazing developers and find great jobs, says full stack developer Lisbeth, who attended Le Wagon's bootcamp.  Once I finished the bootcamp, I stepped into my new position as Junior Developer.’ Currently, Lisbeth works as a Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon and as a Teacher at Tech4Girls whilst looking for her next opportunity.

## Self-taught
If you feel comfortable with your own levels of motivation and like starting by doing, then maybe self-taught learning is the right choice for you.

Programming luminaries Ada Lovelace, Steve Wozniak, Margaret Hamilton, and even John Carmack were all self-taught. Your future senior developer and manager might even be self-taught. You don’t need genius-level ideas so much as putting in the practice. If you study on your own, you can build your own style of learning around your life, creating a schedule that best fits your personality and does not disrupt your life.

Adam, who had previously worked in sales, dabbled in developing and found it to be a perfect fit. You can’t bullshit as a developer. If it does not work, you can’t talk your way out of it. You need to find a solution yourself, he says. It’s unique and fun to learn that alone.
